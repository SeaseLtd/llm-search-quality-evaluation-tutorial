WATCH: Rory Cellan-Jones and Zoe Thomas puzzle out the Z Flip phone\n\nSamsung is making all three models in its new flagship smartphone range 5G-compatible. The top-end Galaxy S20 also introduces a 100x zoom camera.\n\nThe firm also confirmed a new foldable, the Galaxy Z Flip. It uses \"folding glass\" in its display and small fibres in its hinge to protect itself from damage.\n\nSeveral rivals plan their own handset launches over the coming weeks.\n\nBut the spread of the coronavirus poses a threat to production.\n\n\"The virus is going to affect the supply chain,\" said Ben Wood from the consultancy CCS Insight.\n\n\"Although Samsung has diversified its manufacturing into places way beyond China, there will still be components in these phones sourced from China.\"\n\nMany factories in the country have delayed re-opening after its New Year break because of fears the virus could spread in the workplace. China is also the world's biggest smartphone market, and the outbreak has hit local demand.", "link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-51460977", "top_image": "https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/976/cpsprodpb/FFEC/production/_110861556_1dcbb5a0-a7de-457a-80b2-f67bfba4b8f0.jpg"}
