Kodak leaders had already cut 1,200 jobs during the fourth quarter of 2006, bringing the total jobs lost to 23,400 since the company first announced its restructuring plan in January 2004. By the end of this year, that total could reach 30,000, nearly half of the company's size in 2003. The company has already cut excess jobs from its manufacturing division, and will trim the remaining jobs from its selling, general and administrative unit, Kodak Chief Financial Officer Frank Sklarsky said in a release. The move will reduce administrative overhead from Kodak's current level of 18 percent of revenue to just 14 percent to 15 percent. The company has also slashed costs by announcing Jan. 10 it would sell its 8,100-person medical imaging and health-care IT division to the Canadian firm Onex\u00c2\u00a0for $2.55 billion. That deal is expected to close in the first half of 2007. On the revenue side of its books, Kodak hopes to boost income through new products like its consumer inkjet printers, image sensors and picture kiosks, said CEO Antonio Perez. The company will also draw $250 million in revenue by licensing its intellectual-property patents this year, he said. Kodak\u00c2\u00a0introduced a line of inkjet printers\u00c2\u00a0this week to compete with Hewlett-Packard and Xerox. Kodak will target consumers and home-office users by selling replacement ink cartridges at about half the price of its competitors -- just $9.99 for black ink and $14.99 for five-color ink. Likewise, Kodak will sell a range of printers priced below $200. Also on Thursday, Kodak announced it would partner with Mozilla\u00c2\u00a0to improve Kodak's online photo gallery by allowing users to access it from Mozilla's Firefox Web browser. The companies hope to generate more income from the 83 million U.S. users who are predicted to upload, share and print their photographs by 2010. Users can now download the new tool. \u00c2"}

{"id": "192", "title": "Google extends newspaper print-ads service", "description": "(InfoWorld) - Google has expanded its Print Ads so that anyone subscribing to its AdWords program can purchase print advertising from a growing network of newspapers. Google Print Ads, which began with 50 newspapers in November 2006, now has more than 225 newspapers with print advertising available for agencies and advertisers. Now, any U.S.-based advertiser with a Google AdWords account can purchase print advertising for any of these entities, which include newspapers from publishers such as W.W. Scripps, Freedom Communications, Hearst Newspapers, GateHouse Media, Gannett, MediaNews Group, The New York Times, The Seattle Times Company, and the Washington Post, among others. For publishers, Google's print program complements existing sales efforts by providing access to new advertisers and a tool to fill inventory on a timetable, said company representative Deanna Yick. For marketers, Google Print Ads simplifies the selection, scheduling, and delivery of newspaper advertising, and offers advanced targeting tools, transaction processing, and print-campaign reporting, she said. Google also Wednesday said it has renewed its agreement with the Washingtonpost.Newsweek Interactive to deliver search results, search, and contextually targeted advertising to Washingtonpost.com readers. More information about Google Print Ads can be found on Google's Web site. Both Google and rival Yahoo have deals with a network of newspaper companies to sell print advertising through their respective Web-based search advertising services. Yahoo formed its newspaper consortium beginning with 150 newspapers around the same time that Google started its Print Ads program. In April, Yahoo said it had 264 newspapers in its consortium, including the San Francisco Chronicle, the Miami Herald, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, and the Houston Chronicle. On a conference call reporting quarterly financial results Tuesday, Yahoo president Susan Decker said the newspaper consortium is a core area of focus for the company as it tries to grow revenue after\u00c2\u00a0top executive changes, poor financial results, and criticism from investors."}
